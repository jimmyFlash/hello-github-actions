# In entrypoint.sh, all we're doing is outputting a "Hello world" message using an environment variable called MY_NAME.
# Next, we'll define a workflow that uses the GitHub Action.
# Next, we'll define the action.yml file which contains the metadata for our action.
# All actions require a metadata file that uses YAML syntax. The data in the metadata file defines the inputs, outputs and main entrypoint for your action.
# We will use an input parameter to read in the value of MY_NAME.
